# BoilerBudget
BoilerBudget is a two-part ecosystem designed to stop impulsive "lifestyle creep" before it starts. It transforms the boring act of budgeting into a high-stakes life simulation where every dollar spent is a choice between a "Solid Foundation" and a skibidi life. 


We do not want the experience to feel fatiguing so the number of questions are based on the amount of purchase. Thresholds being at $6.7 and $67.
